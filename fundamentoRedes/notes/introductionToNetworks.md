Introduction to Networks
===
## Client to server
> Clients: computers with software installed that enable them to request and display the information obtained from the server.


> Servers: computers with software that enable them to provide information, like email or web pages, to other end devices on the network.

## Peer-to-Peer
Both computers fulfill both the client and server role.

#### Advantages
1. Easy to set up.
2. Less complexity.
3. Lower cost.
4. Can be used for simple tasks.
#### Disadvantages
1. No centralized administration.
2. Not as secure.
3. Not as scalable.
4. All devices MUST act as both roles.

## Network components
The network infrastructure contains three categories of network components:
#### Devices
* End device
  * An end device is either the source or destination of a message transmitted over the network.
![enddevice][enddevice]
* Intermediary Network devices
  * They connect the individual end devices to the network and can connect multiple individual networks to form an internetwork.
![intermediary network devices][intermediary]
#### Media
* Metallic wires within cables
  * Data is encoded into electrical impulses
* Glass or plastic fibers (fiber optic cable)
  * Data is encoded as pulse of light
* Wireless transmission
  * Data is encoded using wavelengths from electromagnetic spectrum

#### Services
  * Many of the common network applications people use very day, like email hosting services and web hosting services.

## Network Representations
* Network interface card
  * A NIC or LAN adapter, provides the physicial connection to the network at the PC or other end device.
* Physicial Port
  * A connector or outlet on a networking device where the media is connected to an end device or another networking device.
* Interface
  * Specialized ports on a networking device that connect to individual networks.

## Types of Network
Network infrastructures can vary in terms of:
* Size of the area covered
* Number of users
* Number and type of services available
* Area of responsability
#### Local Area Network (LAN)
A network infrastructure that provides access to users and end devices in a small geographical area, which is typically an enterprise, home, or small business network owned and managed by an individual or IT department.
* It has an owner.
* Mainly to share resources.

#### Wide Area Network (WAN)
A network infrastucture that provides access to other networks over a wide geographical area, which is typically owned and managed by a telecommunications service provider.
* You have to pay.
* To make connections between different LAN's.

#### Internet
The internet is a worlwide collection of interconnected networks. 
* Home and Small Office Internet connections (need of ISP - Internet Service Provider)
  * Cable
    * Fastest
  * DSL
    * Digital Subscriber lines
  * Cellular
    * Accesible in almost every place
  * Satellite
    * Slower

* Businesses Internet Connections
  * Dedicated Leased Line
    * Very expensive.
    * You don't have to share.
    * Almost not used anymore because it isn't fast enough to be worth it
  * Ethernet WAN
  * DSL
    * sdf
  * Satellite
    * sdf

#### Intranet
Private connection of LAN's and WAN's that belong to an organization, and is designed to be accessible only by the organizations's memebers.

#### Extranet
Provide secure and safe access to individuals who work for a different organization, but require access to the organization's data

## Network Architecture

#### Converged network
It shares all the packages in one channel (videos, phone)
