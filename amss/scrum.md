Scrum
===
### Definition
A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.
1. lightweight
2. simple
3. difficult to master
* Starting in the early 1990's  
### Theory
#### Transparency
* Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible of the outcome.
#### Inspection
* Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirabel variances.
#### Adaptation
* An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

### Scrum team
Consists of:
1. Product Owner
    * Responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team.
    * Responsible for managing the Product Backlog
      * Product Backlog items
      * Order to best achieve goals and missions
      * Optimizing the value of the work
    * One person. Not a committee
    * Everyone must respect his/her decisions
2. Development Team
    * Professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable **_Increment_** of "Done"
    * Self organizing
    * Cross-functional
    * No sub-teams
    * Accountability belongs to the Development Team as a WHOLE
3. Scrum Master
    * Responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide
    * Servant-leader for the Scrum Team
    * Serves the Product Owner:
      * Ensuring that goals are understood
      * Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog managment
      * Understanding and practicing agility
      * Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed
    * Serves the Development Team:
      * Coaching in self-organization and cross-functionality
      * Helping to create high-value products
      * Removing impediments
    * Service to the organization
      * Leading and coaching in scrum adoption
      * Planning scrum implementations
      * Helping employees stakeholders understand and enact Scrum ?
      * Causing change that increases the productivity
### Scrum Events
Prescribed events are used to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.
* All events are time-boxed events
* Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened
#### The sprint
It is a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable, and potentally releasable product **_Increment_** is created.  
During the Sprint:
  * No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
  * Quality goals do not decrease 
  * Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated with the Product Owner
  * To cancel a sprint:
      * Only the Product Owner can do that
      * Only if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete
        * Company changes direction
        * market or technology conditions change
      * All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog
  * Planning
    * Planning must not take more than 8 hours per month Sprint
    * What can be delivered in the Increment?
    * How will the work needed be achieved?

#### Daily Scrum
* 15 min time-boxed event
* At the same time and place each day to reduce complexity

#### Sprint Review
* Held at the end of the Sprint
* Adapts the Product Backlog if needed
* At most a 4 hour meeting for one month sprints

#### Sprint Retrospective
* Three hour meeting for one-month Sprints
* Inspect how the last Sprint went
* Identify and order the major potential improvements
* Create a plan for implementing improvements
