### File types
* Encoded in the _st_mode_ member of the `struct stat`.

File                  |Used for                       |Notes                     |Macro
----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------
Regular File          |Contains data of some form.    |There is no distinction to the UNIX kernel whether this data is text or binary|S_ISREG()
Directory File        |Contains the name of other files and other pointers to information on these files.|Any process that has read permission for a directory file can read the contents, but only the kernel can write directly to a directory file.|S_ISDIR()
Block Special File    |Provides buffered I/O access in fixed-size units to devices such as disk drivers||S_ISBLK()
Character Special File|Provides unbuffered I/O access in variable-sized units to devices||S_ISCHR()
FIFO                  |Used for communication between processes|Is also called _pipe_|S_ISFIFO()
Socket                |Used for network communication between processes||S_ISLNK()
Symbolic link         |File that points to another file||S_ISSOCK()

### Functions

#### stat
```c
#include <sys/stat.h>
int stat(const char *restrict pathname, struct stat *restrict buf);
```
**Returns 0 if OK, -1 on error**
* Returns a structure of information about the named file.
* The _buf_ is a pointer to a structure that we must supply. The functions fill in the structure. See `struct stat` in **Variable types**

#### fstat
```c
#include <sys/stat.h>
int fstat(int filedescriptor, struct *buf);
```
**Returns 0 if OK, -1 on error**
* Obtains information about the file that is already open on the _filedescriptor_.
* The _buf_ is a pointer to a structure that we must supply. The functions fill in the structure. See `struct stat` in **Variable types**

#### fstatat
```c
#include <sys/stat.h>
int fstatat(int filedescriptor, const char *restrict pathname, struct stat *restrict buf, int flag);
```
**Returns 0 if OK, -1 on error**
* Provides a way to return the file statistics for a pathname relative to an open directory represented by the _filedescriptor_ argument.
* The _buf_ is a pointer to a structure that we must supply. The functions fill in the structure. See `struct stat` in **Variable types**

#### lstat
```c
#include <sys/stat.h>
int lstat(const char *restrict pathname, struct stat *restrict buf);
```
**Returns 0 if OK, -1 on error**
* Returns information about the symbolic link, not the file referenced by the symbolic link.
* The _buf_ is a pointer to a structure that we must supply. The functions fill in the structure. See `struct stat` in **Variable types**

#### getcwd()
  * get current work directory 
#### opendir(directory)
  * returns null if it couldnt open the file
    * directory doesnt exit
    * permissions
    * not a directory
#### readdir(directory)
  * goes through all the pointers (NOT FILES) of the files
  * file '.' is the current directory
  * file '..' is the previous directory
  * the file are not ordered. They are how they were inserted
#### stat(filename, &info)
  * receives information of the file and saves it into info
  * variables:
    * _st_mode_ -> to check thing like file type
      * S_ISDIR(info.st_mode)
#### lstat()
  * respects the links
    * stat gives the information of the file that the link is pointing to

### Variables
* _PATH_MAX_
  * Defined by the operating system
  * Always use _PATH_MAX_+1

### Variable type
#### _DIR_
#### _struct dirent_
  * found inside the directory
  * pointers to files
<pre><code>struct dirent{
  ino_t d_ino;                /* Inode number */
  off_t d_off;                /* Not an offset; see below */
  unsigned short d_reclen;    /* Length of this record */
  unsigned char  d_type;      /* Type of file; not supported by all filesystem types */
  char  d_name[256];          /* Null-terminated filename */
}</code></pre>
#### _struct stat_
  * information about a file
<pre><code>struct stat{
  dev_t st_dev;             /* ID of device containing file */
  ino_t st_ino;             /* Inode number */
  mode_t st_mode;           /* File type and mode */
  nlink_t st_nlink;         /* Number of hard links */
  uid_t st_uid;             /* User ID of owner */
  gid_t st_gid;             /* Group ID of owner */
  dev_t st_rdev;            /* Device ID (if special file) */
  off_t st_size;            /* Total size, in bytes */
  blksize_t st_blksize;     /* Block size for filesystem I/O */
  blkcnt_t st_blocks;       /* Number of 512B blocks allocated */

  /* Since Linux 2.6, the kernel supports nanosecond
     precision for the following timestamp fields.
     For the details before Linux 2.6, see NOTES. */

  struct timespec st_atim;  /* Time of last access */
  struct timespec st_mtim;  /* Time of last modification */
  struct timespec st_ctim;  /* Time of last status change */

  #define st_atime st_atim.tv_sec   /* Backward compatibility */
  #define st_mtime st_mtim.tv_sec
  #define st_ctime st_ctim.tv_sec
}</code></pre>
