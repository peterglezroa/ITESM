#### Step 2: Establish a terminal session with S1
1. Click PC1 and then select the Desktop tab.
2. Click the Terminal application icon. Verify that the Port Configuration default settings are correct. What is the setting for bits per second?
**9600**
3. Click OK.
4. The screen that appears may have several messages displayed. Somewhere on the screen there should be a _Press RETURN to get started!_ message. Press ENTER. What is the prompt displayed on the screen?
<pre><code>Switch&gt; </code></pre>

#### Step 3: Explore the IOS Help
1. The IOS can provide help for commands depending on the level accessed. The prompt currently displayed is called User EXEC, and the device is waiting for a command. The most basic form of help is to type a question mark (?) at the prompt to display a list of commands. Which command begins with the letter 'C'?  
<pre><code>S1&gt; ?</code></pre>
**connect**  
2. At the prompt, type 't' and then a question mark (?). Which commands are displayed?
<pre><code>S1&gt; t?</code></pre>
* **telnet**
* **terminal**
* **traceroute**
3. At the prompt, type te and the a question mark (?). Which commands are displayed?
<pre><code>S1&gt; te?</code></pre>
* **telnet**
* **terminal**

### Part 2
#### Step 1: Enter privileged EXEC mode.
1. At the prompt, type the question mark (?). What information is displayed that describes the _enable_ command?
<pre><code>S1&gt; ?</code></pre>
**Turn on priviliged commands**  

2. Type 'en' and press the Tab key? What displays after pressing the Tab key?
<pre><code>S1&gt; en&lt;Tab&gt;</code></pre>
**enable**  

What would happen if you typed te&lt;Tab&gt; at the prompt?  **Nothing because there are more than 1 commands that start with te**  
3. Enter the enable command and press ENTER. How does the prompt change?
**S1 #**  
4. When prompted, type the question mark (?). One command starts with the letter 'C' in user EXEC mode. How many commands are displayed now that privileged EXEC mode is active?
<pre><code>S1# ?</code></pre>
**21 commands**

#### Step 2: Enter Global Configuration mode.
1. When in privileged EXEC mode, one of the commands starting with the letter 'C' is configure. Type the full command or enough of the command to make it unique. Press the &lt;Tab&gt; key to issue the command and press ENTER. 
<pre><code>S1# configure</code></pre>

2. Press ENTER to accept the default parameter that is enclosed in brackets. How dows the prompt change?
**S1(config)#**  

3. This is called global configuration mode. This mode will be explored further in upcoming Press ENTER to accept the default parameter that is enclosed in brackets. How dows the prompt change?

3. This is called global configuration mode. This mode will be explored further in upcoming activities and labs. For now, return to privileged EXEC mode by typing end, exit or ctrl+z
<pre><code>S1 (config)# exit
S1 #</code></pre>

### Part 3
#### Step 1: Use the clock command
1. Use the clock command. Type show clock at the privileged EXEC prompt. What information is displayed? What is the year that is displayed?
**0:28:32.43 UTC Mon Mar 1 1993**

2. Use the context-sensitive Help and the clock command to set the time on the switch to the current time. Enter the command clock and press ENTER. What information is displayed?
**%incomplete command**

3. The "% Incomplete command" message is returned by the IOS. This indicates that the clock command need more parameters. Any time more information is needed, help can be provided by typing a space after the command and the question mark (?). What information is displayed?
**set Set the time and date**  

4. Set the clock using the clock set command. Proceed through the command one step at a time. What informations is being requested?
**hh:mm:ss Month Day Year**

What would have been displayed if only the clock set command had been entered, and no request for help was made by using the question mark?
**%incomplete command**

5. Based  on the information  requested  by issuing the clock  set  ? command,  enter  a time of  3:00  p.m. byusing  the 24-hour  format  of  15:00:00.  Check  to see if more  parameters  are  needed.
The  output returns  a request  for  more  information:  
&lt;1-31&gt;  Day of the month  
MONTH   Month of the yearf.

6. Attempt to set the date  to 01/31/2035  using  the format  requested.  It may be  necessary to requestadditional  help  using the  context-sensitive  Help  to complete the  process. When finished,  issue the showclock command  to display the clock setting. The  resulting  command  output  should  display as:  
*15:0:4.869 UTC Tue Jan 31 2035  
7. If  you were  not successful, try the  following  command  to obtain  the  output above:  
S1# clock set 15:00:00 31 Jan 2035

![packet tracer][step2]
#### Step 2:  Explore additional command  messages. 
1. The  IOS provides  various  outputs  for  incorrect  or incomplete  commands. Continue  to use the clockcommand  to explore  additional  messages  that may be encountered  as you learn  to use  the IOS.  
2. Issue  the following  command  and  record  the messages :  
<pre><code>S1# cl</code></pre>
**Ambiguous command: "cl"**
<pre><code>S1# clock</code></pre>
**% Incomplete command.**  
<pre><code>S1# clock set 25:00:00</code></pre>
**Invalid input**
<pre><code>S1# clock set 15:00:00 32</code></pre>
**Invalid input**
